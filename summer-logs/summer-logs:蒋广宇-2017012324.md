**SQL**

Structured Query Language

1.SQL is a standard language for querying and manipulating data

2.SQL is a very high-level programming language

3.Data Manipulation Language ——Query one or more tables && Insert/delete/modify tuples in tables

4.Data Definition Language ——Define relational schemata && Create/alter/delete tables and their attributes

Set Algebra、Tables、 Data Types、 Table Schemas、 Key constraints、 Declaring Schema、 General Constraints、 

SQL Query:Selection(Select From Where)、 Projection

**A Few Details**

1.SQL commands are case insensitive

2.Values are not

3.Use single quotes for constants

**Indexing and IO Model**

An index is a data structure mapping search keys to sets of rows in table

An index can store 

Operations: Search、 Insert/Remove

Big Scaling with indexes: Hashing-Sorting-Counting

Buffer:A buffer is a part of physical memory used to store temporary data

Disk vs. Main Memory

Disk:Slow、 Durable、Safe 

RAM:Fast、 Volatile、Safe

SSD: between above two

A Simplified Filesystem Model:A page is fixed-sized array of memory. And a file is a variable-length list of pages. Buffer located in main memory operates over pages and files:

External Merge Algorithm

Sort:We can merge lists of arbitrary length with only 3 buffer pages.
