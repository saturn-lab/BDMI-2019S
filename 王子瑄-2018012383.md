云数据平台：可存储数据量庞大，但不能保证数据安全性

**Relational model**:

1. Elegant algebra
2. Every relation has a schema
3. Logical Schema: describes types,names
4. Physical Schema: describes data layout
5. Virtual Schema (Views):  derived tables

**Atomicity**: An action either completes entirely or not at all

**Consistency**: An action results in a state which conforms to all integrity constraints

**Write-ahead logging **:Before any action is finalized, a corresponding log entry is forced to disk

**Key idea**: Keep a log of all the writes done.

**SQL**: 

1. A standard language  for querying and manipulating data
2. a very high-level programming language
3. Data Manipulation Language 
4. Data Definition Language 

**Multiset**: an unordered list (or: a set with multiple duplicate instances allowed)

**Relation or table**: a multiset of tuples having the attributes specified by the schema

**Attribute or column**: a typed data entry present in each tuple in the relation

**Tuple or row**: a single entry in the table having the attributes specified by the schema

The number of tuples is the **cardinality** of the relation

The number of attributes is the **arity** of the relation

The **schema** of a table is the table name, its attributes, and their types

A **key** is an attribute whose values are unique
